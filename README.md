This project presents a system for projection over a mobile region of interest.  The region is supposed to be located on an arbitrarily placed planar surface.  The system consists of a projector, a laptop and an uncalibrated camera.  Our method is based on homography concepts and computes mappings between a camera, a projector and the region.  The technique excludes calibration parameters of the camera and the projector; hence, the intrinsic and extrinsic parameters are neither given nor calculated.  The positions of the projector, the camera, and the surface are unknown.  For the numerous unknowns, we show that each mapping corrected distortion can be achieved.  The system is capable of dynamically identifying the shape of the region of interest in which projection is on, while the region moves with a certain constant speed.  Upon a sudden and abrupt motion of the region of interest, the projection iteratively adjusts its position until it fits the region perfectly.  The system is demonstrated with real examples
